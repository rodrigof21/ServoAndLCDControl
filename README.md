# Servo and LCD control and Game
---

This program controls de angle of a Servo motor with the visual aid of a LCD screen. There are two different modes of operation and a game:
- Direct mode: the servo turns as the potenciometer is turned by the user
- "Choose an Angle" mode: the user chooses an angle on screen by turning the knob and the servo moves to the given angle as the user presses the button
- Game: The LCD shows an angle, the user has to blindly try to move the servo to the right angle. The LCD and the piezo react deppending on how close to the answer it was.

# About the Project

The project began as I was experimenting with the Arduino's starter kit LCD and servo motors. One thing led to the other and I came up with these ideas.
